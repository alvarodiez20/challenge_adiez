### Hi!
This repository includes:
  1. The module `cats_and_cheese.py`, which implements the three main functions:
    1.1. balanced_symbols() - Challenge 1
    1.2. cost_prorating() - Challenge 2
    1.3. water_jugs() - Challenge 3
  2. A unittest file to adress quality standards and can be executed with the following command:
       `python test_cats_and_cheese.py`
  3. A Jupyter Notebook `examples.ipynb` with some examples for each of the functions (the directives to execute it).
  4. This README :)
